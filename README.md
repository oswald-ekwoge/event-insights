# Event-Driven Insights API: 
A portfolio project that demonstrates how to **design and deploy** a scalable, **event-driven architecture** on **Microsoft Azure**. The system **ingests business events in real time**, applies lightweight **machine learning models in Python**, stores enriched results in **cloud databases**, and exposes them through a **FastAPI** service.

# Key highlights:
-> Clean, modular architecture (**Domain, Application, Infrastructure** layers).

-> Event ingestion via **Azure Service Bus** and **Azure Functions**.

-> **Real-time scoring** with **Python** + **scikit-learn**.

-> **Data persistence** in **Cosmos DB** and **Azure SQL**.

-> **REST API** for querying insights, built with **FastAPI**.

-> Fully automated setup with **Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)**.

-> **CI/CD pipelines** for deployment, testing, and blue/green rollouts.

-> Observability with Application Insights (**latency, errors, usage**).
